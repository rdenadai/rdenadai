### ü§Ø Think about

*"As also what troops of diseases beset us, how many casualties hang over our heads, how many troubles invade us, and how little there is that is not steeped in gall?"* The Praise of Folly, Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus

*"One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin."* Metamorphosis, Franz Kafka

*"Before we can understand how to create intelligence, it helps to understand what it is. The answer is not to be found in IQ tests, or even in Turing tests, but in a simple relationship between what we perceive, what we want, and what we do. Roughly speaking, an entity is intelligent to the extent that what it does is likely to achieve what it wants, given what it has perceived."* Human Compatible, Stuart Russell

*"(...) there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain. Our memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim over time."* How to create a Mind, Ray Kurzweil

*"In fact, it is essential to note that the verbal image is not to be confused with the sound itself and that it is psychic, in the same way as the concept associated with it."* Curso de Lingu√≠stica Geral, Ferdinand de Saussure

*"The trick to coming up with novel uses for a brick is to not be attached to its identity as a brick. The trick is to reconceive it as a nonbrick.
I think that bottom-up, details-first thinkers like myself are more likely to have creative breakthroughs just because we don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going. We accumulate details without knowing what they mean and without necessarily attaching emotional significance to them. We seek connections among them without knowing where they‚Äôre taking us. We hope those associations will lead us to the big picture‚Äîthe forest‚Äîbut we don‚Äôt know where we will be until we arrive there. We expect surprises.*" The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum, Temple Grandin
